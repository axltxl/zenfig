Milestone 0.6:
* New command: print. Print a variable to stdout.
* Isolated mode: run zenfig only taking default variables and facts (including defaults from the kit being used)
* Change output_file key to dest in index schema
* A more practical user variable directory: move it from ~/.local/share to ~/.zenfig
