Release 0.1:

* Only show resolved variables (-s, --show-vars)
* Package:
* -------:
  A package is basically a generic service configuration
  schema with both variable and template files targeting
  a specific service (e.g. i3wm). Packages can be downloaded
  and rendered using local variables set by the user.

  Packages are basically file system with the following
  layout:

  * Package root
  |
  |__* templates
  | |__ main.j2
  | |__ (*.j2)
  |__* defaults
     |__ varfile.yml
     |__ hello.yml
     |__ (*.yml)

  Once the package has been downloaded by the mean used,
  it gets rendered using established user variables.
  Variable search paths are applied as always, defaults
  set by the package will be take into account the last
  just after XDG_DATA_HOME/zenfig/vars.
