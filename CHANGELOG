* Kits ecosystem:
  ---------------
  A kit is basically a generic service configuration
  schema with both variable and template files targeting
  a specific service (e.g. i3wm). Kits can be downloaded
  and rendered using local variables set by the user.

  Kits are basically file system with the following
  layout:

  * Kit root
  |
  |__* templates
  | |__ main.j2
  | |__ (*.j2)
  |__* defaults
     |__ varfile.yml
     |__ hello.yml
     |__ (*.yml)

  Once the kit has been downloaded by the mean used,
  it gets rendered using established user variables.
  Variable search paths are applied as always, defaults
  set by the kit will be take into account the last
  just after XDG_DATA_HOME/zenfig/vars.

* Variables ecosystem:
  --------------------
  A bunch of variables are set by default by zenfig
  at startup time, these are default and built-in variables,
  the former are mutable and the latters are not, for the
  moment, they cover basics and will grow along new releases.
